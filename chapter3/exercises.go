*    1. What are two ways to create a new variable?
*       - `var variable1 string = "hello"`
*
*       - `var variable2 string`
*
*    2. What is the value of x after running x := 5; x += 1?
*       - `6`
*
*    3. What is scope? How do you determine the scope of a variable in Go?
*       - The scope is the limit where the variable can be access.
*
*       - You can determine the scope where the variable is declarared:
*         Inside the func  [will be access only on the func]
*         Outside the func [will be access on all func of the package]
*
*    4. What is the difference between var and const?
*       - The const can't be modified the value while the var yes.
*
*    5. Using the example program as a starting point, write a program that converts
*
*    from Fahrenheit into Celsius (C = (F âˆ’ 32) * 5/9).
*
*    6. Write another program that converts from feet into meters (1 ft = 0.3048 m).
